Ras el Hanout Recipe - Fez Variation

Ras el Hanout literally means "head of the shop" in reference to the best what our 'attar (spice seller) has to offer. This blend of fragrant and warm spices is rarely used in Fassi cooking (from Fez), but more often in other regions of Morocco. As such, the type of spices and the quantity differs from one region to another. Since most cooks outside of Morocco won't have access to all of the spices and aromatics typically used, my recipe calls for a smaller list of elements more likely to be found in US and UK supermarkets and ethnic shops. Here is a suggestion of a homemade Ras el Hanout.

Notes
It's practically impossible to find a spice seller who's willing to share his recipe for Ras el hanout, so the recipe posted here is a suggestion. 
It's essential to use the freshest spices possible that have not been lingering in your kitchen for months. When finished mixing the spice blend, store it in an airtight glass jar and place it in a dark place.
