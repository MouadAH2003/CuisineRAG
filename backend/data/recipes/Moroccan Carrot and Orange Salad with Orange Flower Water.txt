You can serve this carrot with chunky cuts of orange or clementine. Just separate the segments and dice them. Add them to the mix.
You also can blend the carrots or press them with a juicer (centrifugeuse), collect the pulp and the juice then add the rest of the ingredients. Adjust the consistency from thick to soupy to your liking.
