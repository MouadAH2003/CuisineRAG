Moroccan Pomegranate Seeds Dessert

While in season, fresh pomegranate seeds are enjoyed by the bowlful in Morocco. Of course they're delicious all on their own, but the Moroccan treatment gives them a subtle flavor boost that your family will love.

InstructionsSeed the pomegranates. Wash the seeds in a bowl of water (remove and discard any pith or stems that rise to the surface) and drain thoroughly.Combine the pomegranate seeds with the orange flower water and sugar to taste. Set aside to macerate for a few minutes, or cover and place in the fridge to chill until serving time.Serve the pomegranate seeds in individual bowls with cinnamon on the side as a garnish.
Notes
I find it easiest to seed pomegranates by cutting them into quarters, then whacking the rind with the back of a heavy spoon. Allow the seeds to drop through your fingers into a bowl. Fill the bowl with water, and use a strainer to remove any pith and membrane that floats to the surface. Drain the seeds and use or serve as desired.
Take time to inspect the sections of pomegranate for bad seeds before whacking. It can be a bit annoying to trying to separate them from good seeds when you notice them later.
