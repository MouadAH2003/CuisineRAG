InstructionsTo Make the Bormache/RfissaIn a large pot or in the base of a couscoussier, combine the chicken, onions, spices and oil. If time allows, cover and leave to marinate in the fridge several hours or overnight.When ready to cook, place the pot over medium heat and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes, turning the chicken several times to brown on all sides.Use a blender or food processor to combine the two peeled tomatoes, garlic, parsley, cilantro, and dried herbs. Add the blended mixture to the pot.Also add the fenugreek, the whole peeled tomato, and 1 liter (4.5 cups) water. Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce the heat a bit and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, for about an hour.If you are using a free range chicken, it will not be fully cooked at this point and should stay in the pot. If you are using a regular, factory-raised chicken, it will be cooked and should be removed from the pot; set it aside, cover with foil and plan to return it to the pot for reheating at serving time.Add the lentils and continue cooking for about another hour, or until the free range chicken and lentils are very tender. Add water as necessary to be sure that there is ample, rich broth in the pot.When the chicken and lentils are fully cooked, taste the broth and adjust seasoning. Add the teaspoon of smen and blend it into the broth. (If you had removed the chicken from the pot, return it to the pot to heat through.)Serve the Bormache/RfissaWhen ready to serve, place the shredded msemen in a steamer basket over the simmering chicken (or over a separate pot of simmering water). Steam for several minutes or until the msemen is tender and heated through.If you like, you can brown the chicken under the broiler for a few minutes to color and crisp the skin.Spread the steamed, shredded msemen on a large serving platter. Top with the chicken, lentils, onions and ample broth. Garnish as desired with chopped fried almonds, dates and hard boiled eggs. Serve as a communal dish with each person eating from his own side of the platter. Additional broth is typically offered on the side.
Notes
A note about fenugreek: Although not a must, I like to soak fenugreek overnight which reduces pungency and contributes to softer cooked texture. Other options for adding the flavor of fenugreek without having to bite into the seeds is to either 1) simmer the fenugreek separately for 30 minutes, then add only the liquid infusion to the rfissa; or 2) tie the fenugreek in cheesecloth before adding it to the rfissa; the flavor will infuse into the broth and the fenugreek seeds can easily be retrieved to offer on the side.
A note about garlic: Instead of processing the garlic as described in the directions, you may leave the head of garlic intact (do remove the papery skin) and offer the cooked garlic on the side as shown in the photo.
A note about lentils: Soaking the lentils in cold water for a few hours will help reduce their cooking time.
