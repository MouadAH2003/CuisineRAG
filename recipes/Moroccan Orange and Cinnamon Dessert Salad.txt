 Moroccan Oranges with Cinnamon and Orange Flower Water

Morocco is widely known for the quality of its citrus, and this easy orange dessert salad is one of many recipes using this bounty of nature. Moroccan oranges are so sweet and fragrant that we hardly need to add sugar to them. Orange blossom water and cinnamon make it even more exquisite. You can substitute mandarins or clementines for the navel oranges; it's equally delicious.
