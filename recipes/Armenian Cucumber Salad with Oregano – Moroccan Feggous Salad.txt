Moroccan Feggous Salad - Armenian Cucumber with Oregano

Feggous is the Moroccan name for the Armenian cucumber, a curved or "bendy" cucumber that's usually eaten unpeeled and is somewhat drier than a regular cucumber. In Morocco, this variety is available in summer, making this salad the perfect answer to hot weather with its refreshing and thirst-quenching qualities.If you can't get hold of Armenian cucumbers, try to use Lebanese or English versions as they tend to have less seeds and a softer skin.
