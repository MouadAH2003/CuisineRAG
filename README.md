<!--
## üéØ Usage Examples

### Command Line Interface

```python
from cuisine_rag import CuisineBot

bot = CuisineBot()

# Basic recipe query
recipe = bot.get_recipe("traditional moroccan tagine")

# Dietary adaptation
vegan_recipe = bot.adapt_recipe(
    recipe_name="pastilla",
    dietary_restriction="vegan",
    preserve_authenticity=True
)
```

### API Endpoints

```bash
# Get recipe
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/recipes/tagine"

# Adapt recipe
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/recipes/adapt" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"recipe": "couscous", "dietary": "gluten-free"}'
```
-->

## üìä Performance Metrics

| Metric | Performance |
|--------|-------------|
| Recipe Retrieval Time | < 10 seconds |
| Adaptation Accuracy | 95% |
